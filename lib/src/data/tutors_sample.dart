I also became an ESL High School Teacher in the Philippines and also in China. I am a dynamic teacher thereby making my classes fun, creative, and interesting. I am providing my students learning with fun. I can teach their beginners vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, as well as improving their speaking and listening communication skills. I love to engage myself with people of different nationalities and cultures because I want to know and be aware also of their cultures and at the same sharing my own Filipino culture with them. I love seeing my students become successful because I believe that their success is also my success. I would be very happy and honored to be a part of your learning the English language. I will always be your guide until you achieve your personal growth and personal goal, if you would permit me. Thank you very much.",
